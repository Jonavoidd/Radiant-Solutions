# Radiant-Solutions
A group project for the final project of our Computer Programming 1

The goal of this project is to build a simple system similar to a POS system.
It has no GUI and will rely on console/terminal for accepting inputs and producing output.
We are a group of 5 who are working together to develop this project.
